                <p>We specialize in interactive experiences that transcend the
                    digital screen. Duty Free’s practice exists within the
                    liminal space between graphic design, algorithmic
                    generation, and art experience. Our practice is guided by
                    the question: <em>what does mutual aid look like within art
                        and
                        design communities?</em></p>
                <p>To us, duty represents a calling to re-imagine design’s
                    purpose as a tool to uplift marginalized communities and to
                    contribute to an informed society.</p>
                <p>To be duty free symbolizes our fundamental belief that the
                    collection of data and resources should not only be
                    decentralized, but also distributed amongst communities.</p>
