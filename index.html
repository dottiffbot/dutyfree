            Duty Free is a design cooperative that specializes in interactive and generative experiences for the web. Duty Free exists as a liminal space between the worlds of graphic design, algorithmic generation, and art experience. To us, “duty” represents a calling to re-imagine design’s purpose as a tool to uplift marginalized communities and to contribute to the betterment of society. To be “duty free” symbolizes a fundamental belief that the collection of data, knowledge and resources should not only be decentralized, but also distributed.
            </p>
            <p>With this belief, we aspire to dedicate our creative passions for the joy of giving without necessarily expecting anything in return.</p>


<p>
As a collective of designers, artists and cultural workers, we want to pose the question in our practice, what does mutual aid look like within design spaces?
