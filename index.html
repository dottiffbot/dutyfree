        Duty Free is a design cooperative that specializes in interactive experiences that transcend the screen. Duty Free’s practice exists within the liminal space between the worlds of graphic design, algorithmic generation, and art experience. 
    
    <br><br>
        To us, “duty” represents a calling to re-imagine design’s purpose as a tool to uplift marginalized communities and to contribute to an informed society. To be “duty free” symbolizes our fundamental belief that the collection of data and resources should not only be decentralized, but also distributed amongst communities.

   <br>
   <br>

        Our practice is guided by the question: what does mutual aid look like within design spaces?
